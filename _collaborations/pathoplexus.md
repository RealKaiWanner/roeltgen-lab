[Pathoplexus](https://pathoplexus.org/) is an open-source platform for sharing viral genome data with transparency, flexibility, and global collaboration at its core. It was built to support researchers and public health teams who need rapid, reliable access to pathogen dataâ€”while also giving data contributors control over how and when their sequences are shared. By integrating powerful tools and a governance model rooted in community engagement, Pathoplexus is changing how we approach genomic data sharing during outbreaks and for endemic disease surveillance, for the better.

Powered by the [Loculus software](https://loculus.org/), Pathoplexus is fast, searchable, and designed to work with diverse data from around the world. Submitters can choose how their data is used, and all submissions are eventually made openly available through public repositories. With strong ties to the bioinformatics community and partnerships across continents, Pathoplexus supports both the science and the scientists, ensuring credit, context, and collaboration go hand in hand.
