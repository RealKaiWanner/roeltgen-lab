The Epidemiology and Virus Evolution (EVE) Lab's purpose is to unravel how viruses evolve and spread in diverse populations and environments. Based at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, our lab combines expertise in viral genomics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics to answer pressing public health and research questions. From studying the evolution of Enteroviruses to tracking ongoing threats like polio and seasonal coronaviruses, we aim to understand how pathogens adapt to our changing behaviours and demographics, and to overcome our immunity.

We are dedicated to transparency and collaboration, allowing us to be involved in many exciting and international collaborations to push the boundaries of science and develop new and useful programs and interfaces. As a lab driven by curiosity and impact, we thrive at the intersection of science, public health, and open research.
