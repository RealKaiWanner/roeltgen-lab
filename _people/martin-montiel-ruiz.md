Martin is a PhD student specializing in Viral Immunology (VIM) at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH). He holds an MSc in Biotechnology from McGill University and has extensive industry experience as a Senior Research Associate at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Scientist I at Vir Biotechnology. His work has involved a variety of viruses including HIV, Influenza, RSV, MPV, SARS-CoV-2 and AAV. During that time he contributed to the development of cutting-edge antiviral therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and siRNAs.

Currently, Martinâ€™s project focuses on exploring the humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses within the Ghanaian population. Using advanced NextGen Single Cell B-cell Receptor sequencing, he investigates the genetic makeup of immune repertoires to understand their unique features and potential role in the relatively milder COVID-19 outcomes observed in Ghana. In addition, Martin is exploring the pre-pandemic antibody cross-reactivity to zoonotic sarbecoviruses and their potential implications in protectivity against SARS-CoV-2. 

Outside of his academic pursuits, Martin seeks adventure through swimming, biking, hiking, and traveling. Reading and tessellation also capture his interest, offering both relaxation and inspiration.
