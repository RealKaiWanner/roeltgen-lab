In collaboration with Prof. Dr. Markus Kalberer at the University of Basel and Prof. Dr. Ernest Weingartner at the University of Applied Sciences (FHNW), this project aims to develop a novel automated instrument capable of detecting airborne pathogens directly at the site of interest—in real time and with high specificity. The system features a high-capacity, high-efficiency particle-into-liquid sampling unit capable of capturing pathogens as small as 50 nm. Monoclonal antibodies with strong affinity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus subtypes (H1, H3, H5) are generated and integrated into the device’s detection platform. The combined technological and immunological advances will be validated through real-world proof-of-concept deployments in environments such as hospitals and nursing homes.
