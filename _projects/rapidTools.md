In the framework of this project we generate human and mouse monoclonal antibodies against different coronaviruses and viral variants using antigen-specific single B cell sorting and hybridoma technology. Monoclonal antibodies will be applied in antigen capture assays for the specific detection of coronavirus and viral variant infection. In addition, we use electrochemiluminescence multi-array technology to detect antibody signatures in plasma to screen populations for previous exposure to different coronavirus variants.
